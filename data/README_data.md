# Data Notes (Survey)

## Source
Survey responses were collected via Google Forms and exported as CSV for analysis.

## Privacy
- The survey collected no direct identifiers (e.g., name, email).
- Raw survey exports are kept local-only by default and are not committed to this repository.

## Reproducibility
To reproduce analysis locally:
1. Place the raw export at: `data/raw/survey_results.csv`
2. Run the notebook: `analysis/notebooks/a3_analysis.ipynb`

If this repository is published publicly, only aggregated/anonymized data should be added.
